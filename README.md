## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS/SCSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

The bigest challenge here was to retrieve a new advice on each new click on the dice.<br>
At first `fetch` or `axios` were not getting a new advice even though I was triggering a new request to the API url.<br>
This was due to `fetch` and `axios` caching data.<br>
To overcome this issue, the solution was to add a timestamp in the URL:<br>

```js
const getData = async () => {
  const url = 'https://api.adviceslip.com/advice';

  const data = await axios.get(`${url}?timestamp=${new Date().getTime()}`);

  setAdvice(data.data.slip);
};
```

I also like this piece of CSS code to get a new image based on the screen size:<br>

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: base.$bp-small-1) {
  content: url('../../images/pattern-divider-mobile.svg');
}
```

The glow around the dice when hovering the element was also pretty fun to create.

### Useful resources

- [Pixel Perfect Pro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-perfect-pro/) - This helped me to display a screenshot on top of the webpage to easily check if dimensions were accurate. This is super useful is you need to create pixel perfect work.
- [PX: Viewport Dimensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/px-viewport-dimensions/) - This add-on will show you the dimensions of your viewport while resizing your browser.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - This helped me resize screenshots provided in the project
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me create a rapid mockup to get dimensions of components.
